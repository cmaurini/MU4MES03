# Build your frame 

Try now to build your own frame. 

1. Build you own frame structure with the Mola model. 
2. Define the corresponding frame model by modifying the example 
3. Choose a load case and perform a qualitative comparison of the structural deformed configuration:
    - Take a photo of the deformed configuration of the real structure under the imposed load
    - Compare qualitatively with the deformed configuration plot obtained with your code

We ask you to submit on moodle at:
