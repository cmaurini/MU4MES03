# Coiled beams

We will show the next lesson that the equivalent extensional and bending stiffness of the coiled beams composing the Mola models are given by
$$(EI)_{eq}=\frac{4EIG}{\pi H(2G+E)n}$$.

where $E$ and $G$ are the Young moduli and the shear stiffness of material composing the coils, $n$ is the number of coils per unit length, $I$ is the
the geometrical quadratic moment of the circular coil cross section, and $H$ is the overall coil diameter. 

1. Design and perform with the Mola model'springs a simple experience to validate this formula. Compare the experimental results with the theoretical prediction.
