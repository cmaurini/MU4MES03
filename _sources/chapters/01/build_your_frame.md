# Build your frame 

Try now to build your own frame. 

1. Build you own frame structure with the Mola model. 
2. Define the corresponding frame model by modifying the example 
3. Choose a load case and perform a qualitative comparison of the structural deformed configuration:
    - Take a photo of the deformed configuration of the real structure under the imposed load
    - Compare qualitatively with the deformed configuration plot obtained with your code

We ask you to submit on moodle at:
- https://moodle-sciences-22.sorbonne-universite.fr/mod/assign/view.php?id=138567 
a pdf print of the notebook including the points above. Name your file as **DM_frame_groupe_Y.pdf**


# Coiled beams

We will show the next lesson that the equivalent extensional and bending stiffness of the coiled beams composing the Mola models are given by
$$
(EI)_{eq}=\frac{4EIG}{\pi H(2G+E)n}
$$
where $E$ and $G$ are the Young moduli and the shear stiffness of material composing the coils, $n$ is the number of coils per unit length, $I$ is the
the geometrical quadratic moment of the circular coil cross section, and $H$ is the overall coil diameter. 

1. Design and perform with the Mola model'springs a simple experience to validate this formula. Compare the experimental results with the theoretical prediction.
